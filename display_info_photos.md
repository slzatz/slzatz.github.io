The following need to be installed:

    sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
    sudo apt-get install python-pygame
    sudo pip install Wand
    sudo pip install sqlalchemy
    pip install paho-mqtt
    
**Note that currently I am running under python 2.7 because at some point in the past, pygame wasn't running under python 3.x but I understand that it now does.**
