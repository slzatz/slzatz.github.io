## ESP8266

Steps to load firmware:

1. Use Devices and printers to see what com port the board is attached to.
2. Erase the flash

       esptool.py --port COM11 erase_flash

3. Load the compiled firmware

       esptool.py --port COM11 --baud 115200 write_flash --flash_size=detect --flash_mode=qio 0 firmware-combined.bin

4. After flashing new firmware, you need to connect the board to WiFi network:

```python
import network
w = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
w.active(True)
w.connect(SSID, PW)
```

Note that most recent version of firmware should have the following in frozen modules

    _boot.py
    font.py
    sonos_remote.py
    umqtt_client.py
    flashbdev.py
    ili9341_text2.py
    ssd1306_min.py
    font2.py
    rgb_text2.py
    umqtt_client_official.py

I renamed `micropython-lib/umqtt.simple/umqtt/simple.py` to`umqtt_client_official.py`.

`esp_display_info.py` subscribes to mqtt topic `esp_tft` and displays the same info as `display_info_photos.py` does on a raspberry pi.  This is not particularly useful since at this point a number of the feeds exceed the size the screen.  However, it may make sense to have it limited to my outlook schedule which would be useful to see in the morning plus ? the weather forecast.  `esp_display_info.py` can also form the basis for `iot_switch.py`.
